We used WordPress as the CMS, Sass for styling, Git for version control, Adobe XD for wireframing, and Asana for project management. I am very proud of this project because it represents months of study and the goals and aspirations for everyone on my team. This project was planned from start to finish, using a mock memo of understanding, wireframes, and development plan."

In our second month of the program, I had created the oracle with vanilla JavaScript, then rewriting it in TypeScript months later. I enjoyed writing this application the most, it tested not only my JavaScript skills, but also my deduction skills. Following my Python course at BCIT, this was my first attempt at writing a complex application in JavaScript and for a front-end environment. Since this application is based on a cultural practice, I did my best to ensure that it was not only culturally accurate, but so that the logic followed a traditional coin toss method."
